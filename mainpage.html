                <span>This application allows for a group of people to vote on which songs are added to a playlist. One person will propose a song, and the group will vote on if it should be added or not. 
                    If it gets 50% or more of the votes, it'll be added to a playlist, preventing just one person from ruining the playlist with their weird taste.
                    First, create a playlist which you can then share with friends. Then, select the playlist you want to add to
                    and suggest a song to be added. It will be voted on and either added or discarded depending on the results. </span>
