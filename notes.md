# Notes for the Semester

## 1/11/2024
Most of this assignment was just github issues, which I was already pretty well versed in how to handle because I've used it for most of my other CS classes, but at least I got to learn a different way to fix merge errors, as I could fix them when they were in the Pull Requests

Service: Calls on service that gains knowledge that is needed (ex: Weather), Maybe for me this is where I can get the list of songs for spotify?
Database: Login info, authtokens and such
Websocket: Bidirectional communication, chat option

## HTML Notes:
1. Just creating a list shouldn't really do anything but I believe the CSS part will make the list able to be added to 
2. Login Button should take to main page
