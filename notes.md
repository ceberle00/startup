# Notes for the Semester

## 1/11/2024
Most of this assignment was just github issues, which I was already pretty well versed in how to handle because I've used it for most of my other CS classes, but at least I got to learn a different way to fix merge errors, as I could fix them when they were in the Pull Requests

Service: Calls on service that gains knowledge that is needed (ex: Weather), Maybe for me this is where I can get the list of songs for spotify?
Database: Login info, authtokens and such
Websocket: Bidirectional communication, chat option

## HTML Notes:
1. Just creating a list shouldn't really do anything but I believe the CSS part will make the list able to be added to 
2. Login Button should take to main page, did this by adding link to the button (there could be an easier or more efficient way to do this, come back and check)
3. Making the playlist page is weird, feels too simple? Not sure if the "add song" feature should be included along with it or in a separate page; was still able to make the playlist just a list of songs, along with the artist and album name included as additional info
4. Searching Feature will eventually search through a database of available songs on spotify
5. The part I don't think I was able to implement here was taking in the text from asking what song they're voting on into the voting application, not sure if I should have it go to another page to pass in the text to say what they're voting on
6. The friend request will obviously have to be updates so it can go through the server and actually request the user
7. Most of this was just buttons and text boxes, I'm assuming the CSS is what actually takes the text from one page to the other and saves it
