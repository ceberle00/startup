  "description": "Have you ever been about to go on a roadtrip with your friends, and you just finished making the perfect playlist for the trip when one of your friends adds the entire Hamilton soundtrack to it? Or a really niche mongolian throat singing song that doesn't fit the vibes at all? This application (name pending) allows for a group of people to vote on which songs are added to a playlist. One person will propose a song, and the group will vote on if it should be added or not. If it gets 50% or more of the votes, it'll be added to a playlist, preventing just one person from ruining the playlist with their weird taste.",
